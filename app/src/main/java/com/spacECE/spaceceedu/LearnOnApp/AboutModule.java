    //1)Payment Gateway,that is after pressing enroll now it should move towards payment process.
    //2)Even if payment get way is yet to be implemented, then atleast by pressing any course it should get added to my course(as if a free course).
    //3) In this module the user  should get the notification regarding process of the course.So kindly implement it,by talking once with Sachin Sir.
