//    Project Started on 27 July, 2021
//    Origin Author: Abhikant Awasthi (https://github.com/abhikant28)
//    Mentor : Sachin Mohite
//    Organization: SpacECE
//    About this Project:
//    Language: Java
//    I started this project with the VideoLibrary (Later known as SpacECE Tube), with just a basic listing
//    When this project began I was only an Intern who had experience of a couple of months of App development
//    and very little knowledge, but throughout this project I learnt a lot. Some of the technologies used
//    include APIs and different types of Views majorly. The file: "UsefuleFunctions" as of now only contains
//    a function to make API calls as a lot of them are made throughout the application. Feel free to add more of those.
